            We here encourage people to inform us about Child Labour and we will do our best to stop them.
            We are connected with NGOs that helps children and raise voice for their rights.
            Children  are future of any country But Millions of children around the world are trapped in child labour,
            depriving them of their childhood, their health and education, putting them in the depth of poverty.

            Of course, there is work that children do to help their families in ways that are neither harmful nor exploitative.
            But many children are stuck in unacceptable work for children â€“ a serious violation of their rights.
            Help us to fight against such practices.
            We aim at stopping child exploitation for a better nation
